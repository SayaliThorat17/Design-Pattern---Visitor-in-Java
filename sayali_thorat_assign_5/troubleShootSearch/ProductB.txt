SeaTools Bootable is a comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic tool that helps you quickly determine the health of your drive.
The flash drive must be at least 256 MBs but no larger than 32 GBs.
Once the bootable media has been created then boot the computer with the media connected to your computer.
If it doesn't boot from the media then boot order may need to be adjusted in the computer BIOS.
Consult the manufacturer for information on changing boot sequence.
